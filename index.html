                  <p>Education, the Environment, Climate Change and Space Exploration are topics closest to his heart as he explores avenues to learn as well as help inspire/motivate students and young engineers on the nuances of a well rounded curriculum spanning the Arts, Humanities and Sciences to truly assess the next steps to combat Climate Change and Environmental Destruction, and how investments made in Space Exploration can help unlock the challenges of constrained resources back home on Earth. In this regard, I have been co-opted in the IEEE Bangalore Executive Committee for 2020 with focus on Education and Humanitarian Technologies.</p>
                  <p>His day job is as a technology leader at Nutanix on next generation Hybrid Cloud Distributed Manageability by leveraging the goodness of IoT, DevOps and ML. His passion for applying Technology across domains in battling Climate Change helped me disrupt the Electric Mobility space at SUN Mobility by delivering the world's first Unified Software IoT Edge Compute Platform for Electric Vehicle Li-Ion Battery Swapping and Charging for Electric Buses, Electric Scooters and Electric Rickshaws. This is currently deployed in production/trials in India and Sri Lanka.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the above, he has had the pleasure of being at the heart of many key technology developments, innovations and disruptions, some of which are listed below:</p>
                  <p>1. Cisco - Technology leadership in the development of the Serviceability platform for next generation DevOps enabled Webex Teams, the global market leader for Cloud based Video-Voice Conferencing.</p>
                  <p>2. DELL - Technology leadership in the development of the iDRAC Embedded Data Center Server Controller with Web Services, an industry first.</p>
